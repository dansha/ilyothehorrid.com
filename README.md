I am passionate about the way people interact with machines and with each other through machines. How can you express exactly what you mean and get exactly what you need?

I have an eclectic approach to development, unlike many programmers, I come from artistic background. I learned to program so I could bring to life complex ideas and somewhere along the way found myself enjoying the pure logical challenges as much as I do conceptual and aesthetic ones.

I believe in minimalism and simplicity, in code and user experience. Many times over I have found that best solutions for programming challenges will not come from code but rather from re-thinking the purpose and necessity of the task at hand. Especially in our world, where advanced technology meets people, growth in complexity will almost always result in lesser understanding and engagement.

I am also a gamer and love good stories.


Sincerely,

Ilya Dorman
